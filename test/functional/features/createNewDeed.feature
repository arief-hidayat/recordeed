Feature: Create New Deed
  As an admin
  I want create new deed
  So that user can select it for their personal goal.

  Scenario: Create Deed that should be performed at specific day.
    Given I am on the Cucumber.js Github repository
    When I go to the README file
    Then I should see "Usage" as the page title
